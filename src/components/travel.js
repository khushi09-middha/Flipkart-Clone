                  We all want to travel, both, in and out of the country - don’t
                  we? But, we blame the lack of those extra bucks in our bank
                  accounts as well as the price of plane tickets for our
                  inability to go out and see the world. However, if you changed
                  a few things about how you plan your trips then you could
                  visit all those dream travel destinations that you’ve been
                  talking about to your buddies at work. Do we have a secret
                  recipe that will make you rich? No. After all, it is
                  impossible for one to become rich overnight (unless you
                  inherited parents’ fortune as Bruce Wayne did). What we have
                  here is a means to keep the wanderlust within you alive

                  flight ticket booking. You may have seen a lot of famous
                  travellers on social media sites visiting 100s of countries.

                  kept spending a king’s ransom on plane tickets? Probably not.
                  One of the major factors that’s responsible for all the
